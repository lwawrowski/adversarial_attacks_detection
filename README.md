# Adversarial Attacks Detection

Repository for paper "Adversarial attacks detection method for tabular data"

The repository is organized as follows:

Scripts:

- models_attacks.py - contains the implementation of the adversarial attacks and models used in the experiments.
- nn_attacks.ipynb - contains the implementation of the neural network model and the adversarial attacks used in the experiments.
- attacks_diagnosis.py - contains the implementation of the diagnostic attributes calculation.
- attacks_metatable.py - contains the implementation of merging all the diagnostic attributes into a single meta-table.
- attack_binary_classifier_with_bacc.ipynb, attack_binary_classifier_without_bacc.ipynb, attack_type_classifier_with_bacc.ipynb, attack_type_classifier_without_bacc.ipynb - contain the implementation of the binary and multi-class classifiers with and without BACC as a diagnostic attribute.

Directories:

- data: contains the datasets used in the experiments.

Due to the large size of the results datasets, they are not included in the repository.
